\subsection{Linear Simultaneous Equations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Definition:} Linear simultaneous equations are two or more equations that must be satisfied at the same time.
    Each equation is a straight line, and their solution is the point where the lines intersect.
    \item \textbf{Methods for Solving Linear Simultaneous Equations}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[1.] \textbf{Elimination Method:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Multiply one or both equations to align one variable so that when you add or subtract the equations, one
            variable cancels out.
            \item Solve for the remaining variable, and substitute back to find the other.
        \end{itemize}
        \item[2.] \textbf{Substitution Method:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Solve one equation for one variable in terms of the other.
            \item Substitute this into the second equation to find the value of the other variable.
            \item Substitute the value of the first variable back into the original equation to find the second variable.
        \end{itemize}
